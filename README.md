## Hi, visitor 👋

This is Marta, a data analyst with background in medicine and public health, messing around with many other seemengly unrelated things.
- 🤓 I'm interested in all evidence and data driven. 📊
- 🖥️ I've worked with Stata and a tiny bit of R for Public Health research, but what you'll find here are python projects. 🐍
- 🎮 From time to time, there'll be some C# too. 🕹️
