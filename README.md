## Hi, visitor 👋

This is Marta, a data analyst with background in medicine and public health, messing around with many other seemengly unrelated things.
- :woman_technologist: Software developer (Java, Kotlin, css, SQL...) and a bit of web dev too.
- 🤓 I'm interested in all evidence and data driven. 📊
- 🖥️ In the past I've worked with Stata and a tiny bit of R for Public Health research.
- 🐍 You'll find here are **Python** projects. I plan to work much more with Python in the future.
- 🎮 From time to time, there'll be some C#. 🕹️
