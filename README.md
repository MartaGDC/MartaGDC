## Hi, visitor ðŸ‘‹

This is Marta, a data analyst with background in medicine and public health, messing around with many other seemengly unrelated things.
- :nerd_face: I'm interested in all evidence and data driven. :bar_chart:
- :desktop_computer: I've worked with Stata and a tiny bit of R for Public Health research, but what you'll find here are python projects. :snake:
- :video_game: From time to time, there'll be some C# too. :joystick:
